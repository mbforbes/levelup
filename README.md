# levelup
Track minutes, gain experience for skills and levels, fight bosses, get rewards. [Live alpha](http://rhubarb-crisp-2752.herokuapp.com/).

_A mockup of the UI I made (in Word!)_



## Setup
You need two files, which are both one-liner filess with URLs to an **old** Google Docs Spreadsheet with certain data format.
- `exp_url` :   exp format (specified in web.js)
- `abilities_url` : abilities format (specified in web.js)

## TODO
- favicon.ico
- rest of the formatting
- specify doc formats here
- (if wanted eventually) bosses
- (if wanted eventually) rewards
- (eventually) faster loading (e.g. period pinging of google apps)

## Related work
After having done my brainstorming, background research on why games are addicting, needs analysis, level math and balancing, mockups, and most of the backend / frontend coding, I then discovered [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/).

This will be a simple, less-featured version of HabitRPG, which only tracks habits (and not TODOs and the rest). It also won't have pretend rewards.

Why not switch over to HabitRPG? Here is why I'm going to continue development on `levelup` instead:

* HabitRPG tries to get you to track too much, and all those extra features I don't need will distract me from what I really care about (establishing daily habits).

* HabitRPG has ads, and a cluttered UI to support the above.

* It's really easy to cheat HabitRPG. I made an account and clicked that I did something fifty times, and got tones of rewards. The whole reason RPGs are addicting is that you can't cheat. As sooon as I turn cheats on in any game, it loses all its appeal

## Acknowledgements
The UI is heavily inspired by Persona 3: FES for the PS2. The concept is as well (addicting JRPGs...). So, hats off to the developers of P3FES!
