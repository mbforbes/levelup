# levelup
Track minutes, gain experience for skills and levels, fight bosses, get rewards.

## Setup
You need two files, which are both one-liner filess with URLs to an **old** Google Docs Spreadsheet with certain data format.
- `exp_url` :   exp format (to be specified)
- `abilities_url` : abilities format (to be specified)

## TODO
- favicon.ico
- rest of the formatting
- (if wanted eventually) bosses
- (if wanted eventually) rewards
- (eventually) faster loading (e.g. period pinging of google apps)

## Acknowledgements
The UI is heavily inspired by Persona 3: FES for the PS2. The concept is as well (addicting JRPGs...). So, hats off to the developers of P3FES!
